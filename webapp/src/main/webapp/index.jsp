  </p> My Another Poem </p>

<p>

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.

</p>
  
  </p>
  
  That night, I opened your wardrobe and found
a trophy of vultures, their necks pierced
  </p>
</p>

by hanger hooks. I saw at once
that you hunted everything I loved
</p>
</p>

the griffon, the Himalayan, the lammergeier,
who haunted our home with wheeling cries.
</p>
</p>

I peeled off my skin then, and robed myself
as a bird bride. Veiled in morning mist
</p>
</p>

I married the sky. Of course, you aimed
at my heart, but as the bullet tore through me
</p>
</p>

I wrapped my talons around your skull,
lifted you high, and dropped you as a lamb
</p>
</p>

drops newborn from his mother
onto the snow-fleeced earth.
</p>
</p>

I landed beside you on the quilt.
And when the flesh-eaters had done their work,
</p>
</p>

it was I, your lammergeier daughter,
who devoured your bonesâ€”look, Father,
</p>
</p>

how they slide down my throat like rifles.
